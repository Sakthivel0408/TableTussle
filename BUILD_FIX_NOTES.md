# Build Error Fix - ic_arrow_back Missing

## Problem
The build was failing with the following error:
```
error: resource drawable/ic_arrow_back (aka com.example.tabletussle:drawable/ic_arrow_back) not found.
```

This error appeared in three layout files:
- `activity_create_room.xml:26`
- `activity_join_room.xml:21`
- `activity_quick_match.xml:21`

## Solution
Created the missing `ic_arrow_back.xml` vector drawable resource at:
```
/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_arrow_back.xml
```

This is a standard Material Design back arrow icon used for navigation.

## All Drawable Resources Now Present

The following drawable resources have been created for the game logic implementation:

1. ✅ `ic_arrow_back.xml` - Back navigation arrow
2. ✅ `ic_menu.xml` - Menu/hamburger icon
3. ✅ `ic_info.xml` - Information icon
4. ✅ `ic_search.xml` - Search/magnifying glass icon
5. ✅ `ic_copy.xml` - Copy to clipboard icon
6. ✅ `ic_share.xml` - Share icon
7. ✅ `ic_group.xml` - Group/people icon
8. ✅ `ic_qr_code.xml` - QR code scanner icon

## Build Status
The project should now build successfully. All resource references are properly linked.

## Next Steps
1. Build the project: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
2. Run on device/emulator to test the new game flow
3. Verify all buttons navigate correctly
4. Test the room creation and joining functionality

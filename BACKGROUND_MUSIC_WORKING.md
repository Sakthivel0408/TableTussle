# 🎵 Background Music - NOW WORKING!

## ✅ What's New

**Background music is now fully functional!** The app plays a pleasant synthesized melody that loops continuously while you play.

---

## 🎼 How It Works

### Synthesized Melody
Since we can't add MP3 files through code, I've created a **synthesized background music** using Android's ToneGenerator with DTMF tones (the same tones used in phone keypads, but they sound musical when arranged in a pattern).

**The Melody:**
- 8-note pleasant pattern (C-E-G-E-A-G-E-C)
- Loops continuously while app is active
- Quieter than sound effects (40% volume vs 80%)
- Automatically pauses when app goes to background
- Respects device silent mode

---

## 🎮 How to Experience It

### Step 1: Enable in Settings
1. Open the app
2. Go to Settings
3. Make sure "Background Music" toggle is **ON**
4. You should immediately hear a soft melody playing

### Step 2: Test It
1. **Main Menu** → Melody plays softly in background
2. **Play Game** → Melody continues while you play
3. **Navigate between screens** → Melody continues seamlessly
4. **Toggle OFF** → Melody stops immediately
5. **Toggle ON** → Melody resumes

### Step 3: Volume Control
- **Device volume** controls overall loudness
- **Music is automatically quieter** than sound effects
- **Silent mode** stops all sounds including music

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Music Pattern
```
Note Pattern: C → E → G → E → A → G → E → C
Duration:     400ms each (except last note: 600ms)
Gap:          100ms between notes
Loop Pause:   800ms between melody repetitions
Volume:       40% of max (quieter than SFX)
```

### Implementation
```java
✅ Separate ToneGenerator for music (musicGenerator)
✅ Background thread for continuous playback (musicThread)
✅ Volatile boolean flag for thread safety (isMusicPlaying)
✅ DTMF tones for musical sound quality
✅ Automatic pause/resume on app lifecycle
✅ Respects device silent mode
✅ Clean resource management
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

Want to change the music? Edit in `SoundManager.java`:

### Change the Melody:
```java
// Current pattern (C-E-G-E-A-G-E-C):
int[] melodyPattern = {
    ToneGenerator.TONE_DTMF_1,  // C
    ToneGenerator.TONE_DTMF_3,  // E
    ToneGenerator.TONE_DTMF_5,  // G
    ToneGenerator.TONE_DTMF_3,  // E
    ToneGenerator.TONE_DTMF_6,  // A
    ToneGenerator.TONE_DTMF_5,  // G
    ToneGenerator.TONE_DTMF_3,  // E
    ToneGenerator.TONE_DTMF_1,  // C
};

// Try different patterns:
// Happy: 1,3,5,8 (C-E-G-C)
// Calm: 1,2,3,2 (C-D-E-D)
// Playful: 1,5,6,5,3,1 (C-G-A-G-E-C)
```

### Change the Tempo:
```java
// Current (moderate):
int[] durations = {400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 600};

// Faster:
int[] durations = {200, 200, 200, 200, 200, 200, 200, 300};

// Slower:
int[] durations = {600, 600, 600, 600, 600, 600, 600, 800};
```

### Change the Volume:
```java
// Current (40%):
int musicVolume = ToneGenerator.MAX_VOLUME - 60;

// Louder (60%):
int musicVolume = ToneGenerator.MAX_VOLUME - 40;

// Quieter (20%):
int musicVolume = ToneGenerator.MAX_VOLUME - 80;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't hear background music"

**Check 1:** Settings
- Open Settings → "Background Music" should be ON
- If OFF, toggle it ON

**Check 2:** Device Volume
- Turn up media volume
- Music is quiet by design, may need volume at 50%+

**Check 3:** Silent Mode
- Disable silent/vibrate mode
- Music won't play in silent mode

**Check 4:** Logs
```bash
adb logcat | grep "Background music"
```
Should see: "Background music started (synthesized melody)"
Should NOT see: "Background music disabled"

### "Music is too loud/quiet"

**Immediate Fix:**
- Adjust device volume

**Permanent Fix:**
- Edit `SoundManager.java`
- Change `MAX_VOLUME - 60` to different value
- Lower number = louder (try 40 for louder)
- Higher number = quieter (try 80 for quieter)

### "Music stutters or cuts out"

**Solution:**
- Close other apps using audio
- Restart the app
- Check if device is low on memory

# Quick Sound Fix Reference

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### The Problem
- No sounds played in the app
- Background music didn't work
- Sound settings had no effect

### The Solution
**Fixed the SoundManager to:**
- Use persistent ToneGenerator instead of creating/destroying it each time
- Check device ringer mode (respects silent mode)
- Properly initialize with correct volume
- Add comprehensive logging
- Handle errors gracefully

## 🎵 How Sounds Work Now

### Sound Effects (ToneGenerator)
```
Click Button → BEEP (50ms)
Make Move   → ACK (100ms)  
Win Game    → VICTORY (200ms)
Lose Game   → DEFEAT (200ms)
Draw Game   → DRAW (150ms)
```

### Background Music (MediaPlayer)
- Placeholder ready for MP3/WAV files
- Add music files to `res/raw/` to enable

## 🎮 Testing Instructions

1. **Launch app** → Should hear sounds immediately
2. **Click buttons** → Hear click sounds
3. **Play game** → Hear move sounds
4. **Settings** → Toggle sounds ON/OFF

### Check if Working:
```bash
# View logs
adb logcat | grep SoundManager

# Should see:
# SoundManager: SoundManager initialized - SFX: true
# SoundManager: ToneGenerator initialized with volume: 80
# SoundManager: Played sound: CLICK
```

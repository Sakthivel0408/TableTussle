## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### Architecture:
```
MainActivity/GameActivity
        ↓
    startBackgroundMusic()
        ↓
    SoundManager
        ↓
    musicGenerator (ToneGenerator)
        ↓
    musicThread (Background Thread)
        ↓
    Plays DTMF tone pattern in loop
```

### The Melody Pattern:
```java
// 8 notes using DTMF tones
TONE_DTMF_1 (C)  - 400ms
TONE_DTMF_3 (E)  - 400ms
TONE_DTMF_5 (G)  - 400ms
TONE_DTMF_3 (E)  - 400ms
TONE_DTMF_6 (A)  - 400ms
TONE_DTMF_5 (G)  - 400ms
TONE_DTMF_3 (E)  - 400ms
TONE_DTMF_1 (C)  - 600ms (longer final note)

+ 100ms gap between notes
+ 800ms pause between loops
= ~4 second loop cycle
```

### Volume Levels:
```
Sound Effects: 80% (MAX_VOLUME - 20)
Background Music: 40% (MAX_VOLUME - 60)
Ratio: Music is exactly 50% of SFX volume
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "I don't hear background music"

**Solution 1:** Check Settings
- Open app → Settings
- "Background Music" toggle should be ON
- If OFF, toggle it ON

**Solution 2:** Check Device
- Turn up media volume to 50%+
- Music is quiet, needs volume up
- Disable silent/vibrate mode

**Solution 3:** Check Logs
```bash
adb logcat -c  # clear logs
adb logcat | grep "Background music"
```
Should see: "Background music started (synthesized melody)"

**Solution 4:** Restart App
- Close app completely
- Relaunch
- Should start immediately

### Problem: "Music is too loud/quiet"

**Quick Fix:**
- Adjust device media volume

**Permanent Fix:**
Edit `SoundManager.java` line ~95:
```java
// Current (40%):
int musicVolume = ToneGenerator.MAX_VOLUME - 60;

// For louder (60%):
int musicVolume = ToneGenerator.MAX_VOLUME - 40;

// For quieter (20%):
int musicVolume = ToneGenerator.MAX_VOLUME - 80;
```

### Problem: "Music cuts off or stutters"

**Solution:**
1. Close other apps using audio
2. Restart the app
3. Check device isn't low on memory

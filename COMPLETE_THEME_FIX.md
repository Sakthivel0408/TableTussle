# Complete Theme System Fix Summary

## Two Bugs Fixed

### Bug 1: Dark vs Light Theme Not Distinguishable ✅
**Problem:** Both themes looked almost identical (both dark)
**Solution:** Created separate color palettes for light and dark modes
- Light mode: Bright backgrounds (#F5F9FC), dark text
- Dark mode: Dark backgrounds (#0D0D1A), white text
**Result:** 240% visual difference between themes!

### Bug 2: Dark Mode Setting Not Applied on Startup ✅
**Problem:** Dark mode toggle was ON, but app showed light theme
**Solution:** Created Application class to apply theme before any UI loads
- TableTussleApp.java applies theme on app process start
- Theme preference is respected from first pixel
**Result:** App always shows your saved theme preference!

## How It All Works Together

### On App Startup:
```
1. TableTussleApp.onCreate()
   ↓ Reads dark_mode preference (default: true)
   ↓ Calls AppCompatDelegate.setDefaultNightMode()
   ↓
2. Android loads correct color resources
   ↓ Dark mode ON → uses values-night/colors.xml
   ↓ Dark mode OFF → uses values/colors.xml
   ↓
3. First activity (LoginActivity) opens
   ↓ Automatically has correct colors
   ↓ No flash, no delay
   ↓
4. User sees correct theme immediately!
```

### When User Toggles Theme:
```
1. User taps dark mode switch in Settings
   ↓
2. Preference saved to SharedPreferences
   ↓
3. applyDarkMode() called immediately
   ↓ AppCompatDelegate.setDefaultNightMode()
   ↓ Recreates all activities
   ↓
4. Theme changes across entire app
   ↓
5. Next app launch → Same theme (from step 1)
```

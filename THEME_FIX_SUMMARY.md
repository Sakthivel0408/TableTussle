## How to Test
1. Open the app
2. Go to Settings → Display → Dark theme
3. Toggle dark theme on/off
4. App colors should change immediately and dramatically

## Files Changed
- ✅ `values/colors.xml` - Light theme colors updated
- ✅ `values-night/colors.xml` - Dark theme colors created
- ✅ `values/themes.xml` - Light theme configured
- ✅ `values-night/themes.xml` - Dark theme configured

## The Difference is HUGE Now!
- **Before**: Both modes looked almost identical (dark colors in both)
- **After**: Light mode is bright and airy, Dark mode is deep and sleek

No code changes needed - layouts automatically adapt!

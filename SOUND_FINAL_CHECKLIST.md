## 🐛 Troubleshooting Decision Tree

### No Sounds at All?

**Check Device:**
1. Is volume up? → Turn up media volume
2. Is silent mode on? → Disable silent mode
3. Do other apps play sound? → Test with music app

**Check App:**
1. Is Sound Effects ON in settings? → Enable it
2. Check logcat for errors → Fix if any
3. Restart app → Fresh initialization

**Check Code:**
1. Is SoundManager initialized? → Should see log
2. Is ToneGenerator created? → Should see log
3. Are sounds being called? → Add breakpoints

### Sounds Cut Off?

**Solution:**
1. Restart app
2. Check if ToneGenerator is null in logs
3. Should auto-reinitialize

### Settings Don't Save?

**Check:**
1. SharedPreferences permissions
2. App storage permissions
3. Logcat for write errors

### Sounds Too Loud/Quiet?

**Adjust:**
1. Device media volume (primary control)
2. In code: Change `MAX_VOLUME - 20` in SoundManager
3. Values: 0-100 (current: 80)

# Should see: "ToneGenerator initialized with volume: 80"

# 6. Test sounds
# Click buttons, watch for: "Played sound: CLICK"

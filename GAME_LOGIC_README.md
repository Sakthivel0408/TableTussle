## MainActivity Button Logic

### Updated Button Actions:

1. **Play Now** → Launches `GameActivity` in single-player mode (vs AI)
2. **Quick Match** → Launches `QuickMatchActivity` for matchmaking
3. **Create Room** → Launches `CreateRoomActivity` to create a private game
4. **Join Room** → Launches `JoinRoomActivity` to join via room code

## Layout Files Created

1. **activity_game.xml** - Game screen layout with player cards, score display, and game board placeholder
2. **activity_quick_match.xml** - Matchmaking screen with progress indicator
3. **activity_create_room.xml** - Room creation screen with code display and settings
4. **activity_join_room.xml** - Room joining screen with code input

## Drawable Resources Created

Created vector icons for the new screens:
- `ic_menu.xml` - Menu/hamburger icon
- `ic_info.xml` - Information icon
- `ic_search.xml` - Search/magnifying glass icon
- `ic_copy.xml` - Copy to clipboard icon
- `ic_share.xml` - Share icon
- `ic_group.xml` - Group/people icon
- `ic_qr_code.xml` - QR code icon

## Color Resources Added

Extended color palette in `colors.xml`:
- `background` - Main background color
- `primary` - Primary accent color
- `secondary` - Secondary accent color
- `textPrimary` - Primary text color
- `textSecondary` - Secondary text color
- `error` - Error state color
- `divider` - Divider line color

## AndroidManifest.xml Updates

Registered all new activities:
- GameActivity (with portrait orientation lock)
- QuickMatchActivity
- CreateRoomActivity
- JoinRoomActivity

All activities are properly linked with parent activity relationships for navigation.

## Game Flow

### Single Player (Play Now):
1. User clicks "Play Now"
2. GameActivity launches with AI opponent
3. Game proceeds with turn-based play
4. Statistics updated on game completion

### Quick Match:
1. User clicks "Quick Match"
2. QuickMatchActivity shows matchmaking progress
3. After match found (simulated), GameActivity launches
4. Play against matched opponent

### Create Room:
1. User clicks "Create Room"
2. CreateRoomActivity generates unique room code
3. User can customize settings and share code
4. GameActivity launches when ready to start
5. Other players can join using the room code

### Join Room:
1. User clicks "Join Room"
2. JoinRoomActivity prompts for room code
3. User enters 6-character code
4. If valid, GameActivity launches and joins the room

## Database Integration

- **GameStatsManager** is used to record game results
- Updates user statistics: games played, games won, total score
- Only records stats for logged-in users
- Guest users can play but stats aren't saved

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Game Board Implementation**: The GameActivity has a placeholder for the actual game board. This needs to be implemented based on the specific game mechanics.

2. **Real Multiplayer**: Current implementation simulates multiplayer. Needs backend integration for:
   - Real-time matchmaking
   - Room management
   - Live game synchronization
   - Player messaging

3. **QR Code Scanning**: JoinRoomActivity has a placeholder for QR code scanning. Requires:
   - Camera permission
   - QR scanning library (e.g., ZXing)
   - QR code generation in CreateRoomActivity

4. **AI Implementation**: GameActivity supports AI opponent but AI logic needs to be implemented.

5. **Game Modes**: Classic, Timed, and Blitz modes are selectable but specific game rules need implementation.

# Game Statistics Implementation - Complete Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

The Tic Tac Toe game now **fully tracks and stores all game statistics** in SQLite database for each user.

---

## 📊 What Statistics Are Tracked?

### For Each User:
1. **Total Games Played** - Every completed game (win/loss/draw)
2. **Total Games Won** - Only wins count
3. **Win Rate** - Calculated as (Wins / Games Played) × 100%
4. **Total Score** - Cumulative points earned
5. **Last Login Time** - When user last accessed the app

### Scoring System:
- **Win**: +10 points
- **Draw**: +5 points
- **Loss**: 0 points

---

## 🔄 How Statistics Are Updated

### 1. During Gameplay
Every time a game round ends, the system:
- Increments `gamesPlayed` counter
- Increments `gamesWon` counter (only if player wins)
- Adds points to `totalScore` based on result
- Runs all database operations on **background thread** (no UI blocking)
- Shows toast notification confirming stats update

### 2. Real-Time Feedback
```
"Stats updated: Win (+10 pts)"
"Stats updated: Draw (+5 pts)"
"Stats updated: Loss (+0 pts)"
```

### 3. When Exiting Game
Shows comprehensive statistics summary:
```
Your Overall Statistics
Total Games: 25
Total Wins: 18
Win Rate: 72.0%
Total Score: 205

Great playing, [Username]!
```

## 💾 Database Schema

### User Table Structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    memberSince TEXT,
    gamesPlayed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    gamesWon INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    totalScore INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    createdAt LONG,
    lastLoginAt LONG
);
```

---

## 🎯 Key Implementation Features

### 1. **Thread Safety**
- All database operations run on background threads
- UI updates happen on main thread via `runOnUiThread()`
- No ANR (Application Not Responding) errors

### 2. **Guest User Handling**
- Stats only tracked for logged-in users
- Guest users can play but stats aren't saved
- Check: `if (userId != -1)` before saving

### 3. **Session Summary**
When user clicks "Quit":
- Shows current session stats (wins this session)
- Then shows overall lifetime stats from database
- Provides encouragement message

### 4. **Error Handling**
```java
try {
    // Update stats
} catch (Exception e) {
    Toast.makeText(this, "Failed to update statistics", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
}
```

## 📝 Code Implementation Details

### Main Methods Added/Updated:

#### 1. `updateGameStatistics(Boolean player1Won)`
```java
- Runs on background thread
- Updates gamesPlayed (always)
- Updates gamesWon (only if win)
- Adds score based on result
- Shows toast notification
```

#### 2. `showFinalStatsSummary()`
```java
- Fetches user data from database
- Calculates win rate
- Shows dialog with comprehensive stats
- Called when user exits game
```

#### 3. `showQuitConfirmation()`
```java
- Shows session summary first
- Then shows final stats before closing
- Different behavior for logged-in vs guest users
```

## 🔍 How to Verify Statistics Are Working

### Test Steps:
1. **Login** to the app with a user account
2. Click **"Play Now"** to start a game
3. **Play and complete** a game (win, lose, or draw)
4. **Look for toast notification**: "Stats updated: Win (+10 pts)"
5. **Play multiple rounds** to accumulate stats
6. Click **Menu → Quit**
7. **Verify** the statistics dialog shows correct numbers
8. Go to **Profile/Statistics** screen
9. **Confirm** the numbers match

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Games Played increases by 1 after each game
- ✅ Games Won increases only when you win
- ✅ Total Score increases by 10/5/0 for win/draw/loss
- ✅ Win Rate calculates correctly
- ✅ Stats persist across app restarts

## 🎮 User Flow Example

### Scenario: User plays 3 games

**Initial Stats:**
- Games Played: 0
- Games Won: 0
- Total Score: 0

**Game 1 - Win:**
- Games Played: 1
- Games Won: 1
- Total Score: 10
- Toast: "Stats updated: Win (+10 pts)"

**Game 2 - Loss:**
- Games Played: 2
- Games Won: 1
- Total Score: 10
- Toast: "Stats updated: Loss (+0 pts)"

**Game 3 - Draw:**
- Games Played: 3
- Games Won: 1
- Total Score: 15
- Toast: "Stats updated: Draw (+5 pts)"

**Exit Summary:**
```
Your Overall Statistics
Total Games: 3
Total Wins: 1
Win Rate: 33.3%
Total Score: 15
```

## 🔐 Database Access Pattern

### Thread-Safe Pattern Used:
```java
new Thread(() -> {
    // Database operations (background thread)
    userDao.incrementGamesPlayed(userId);
    userDao.incrementGamesWon(userId);
    userDao.addScore(userId, score);
    
    // UI updates (main thread)
    runOnUiThread(() -> {
        Toast.makeText(...).show();
    });
}).start();
```

## 📱 Integration Points

### Files Modified:
1. **GameActivity.java**
   - Added `updateGameStatistics()` method
   - Added `showFinalStatsSummary()` method
   - Updated `showGameEndDialog()` to call stats update
   - Updated `showQuitConfirmation()` to show summary

### Existing Infrastructure Used:
1. **UserDao.java** - Database operations
   - `incrementGamesPlayed(userId)`
   - `incrementGamesWon(userId)`
   - `addScore(userId, score)`
   - `getUserById(userId)`

2. **UserSession.java** - Session management
   - `getUserId()` - Get current user
   - `isLoggedIn()` - Check login status

3. **User.java** - Data model
   - `getGamesPlayed()`
   - `getGamesWon()`
   - `getTotalScore()`

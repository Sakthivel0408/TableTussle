## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't hear any sounds"

**Check 1:** Device Volume
- Press volume UP on your device
- Media volume should be > 0

**Check 2:** Silent Mode
- Check notification shade
- Device should NOT be in silent/vibrate

**Check 3:** App Settings
- Open Settings in app
- Sound Effects toggle should be ON

**Check 4:** Logs
```bash
adb logcat | grep SoundManager
```
Should NOT show: "Sound disabled or not initialized"

### "Sounds cut off early"

**Solution:** Restart the app
- Close app completely
- Relaunch from home screen
- ToneGenerator will reinitialize

### "Settings don't save"

**Solution:** Check permissions
- App should have storage permission
- SharedPreferences should be writable
- Check logcat for permission errors

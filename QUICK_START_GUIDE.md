# Quick Start Guide - Tic Tac Toe Game

## What Was Implemented

A fully functional **Tic Tac Toe game** with an intelligent AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm for perfect play.

## Quick Overview

### Player Experience
1. Click "Play Now" button on main screen
2. Game loads with 3x3 grid
3. You play as "X" (red color)
4. AI plays as "O" (purple color)
5. Tap any empty cell to make your move
6. AI responds automatically after 0.5-1 second
7. First to get 3 in a row wins!
8. Play multiple rounds - scores are tracked

### Key Features
- âœ… **Smart AI**: Uses Minimax algorithm - never makes mistakes
- âœ… **Score Tracking**: Wins are counted across rounds
- âœ… **Visual Feedback**: Different colors for each player, winning cells highlighted in gold
- âœ… **Database Integration**: Stats saved to your profile
- âœ… **Professional UI**: Material Design with smooth animations

## Files Changed

### 1. GameActivity.java
**Location**: `/app/src/main/java/com/example/tabletussle/GameActivity.java`

**What was added**:
- Complete game board management
- Minimax AI algorithm (unbeatable)
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Score tracking across rounds
- Move validation
- UI updates and visual feedback

**Key Methods**:
- `onCellClicked(row, col)` - Handle player moves
- `makeAIMove()` - AI makes its move
- `findBestMove()` - Minimax algorithm entry point
- `minimax(depth, isMaximizing)` - Recursive game tree evaluation
- `checkWinner(player)` - Detect wins
- `highlightWinningCells()` - Visual feedback for wins

### 2. activity_game.xml
**Location**: `/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_game.xml`

**What was added**:
- GridLayout with 3x3 grid of MaterialButtons
- Each button represents a cell (IDs: cell_0_0 to cell_2_2)
- Proper styling and spacing
- Responsive design

### 3. colors.xml
**Location**: `/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml`

**What was added**:
- `cardBackground` - Background color for cells
- `cardStroke` - Border color for cells
- `accent` - Gold color for winning cells

### 4. strings.xml
**Location**: `/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`

**What was added**:
- `menu`, `info` - Content descriptions
- `player_1`, `player_2` - Default player names
- `zero`, `player_turn` - UI text

## How the AI Works

### Minimax Algorithm
The AI evaluates all possible future game states and chooses the move that guarantees the best outcome.

**Scoring System**:
- AI wins: +10 (minus depth to prefer faster wins)
- Player wins: -10 (plus depth to delay losses)
- Draw: 0

**Example**: If the AI can win in 2 moves or 4 moves, it chooses 2 moves (score: 10-2=8 vs 10-4=6).

**Result**: The AI is unbeatable. The best a player can achieve is a draw.

## Game Flow

```
Start Game
    â†“
Player's Turn (X)
    â†“
Player taps cell
    â†“
Update board & check win
    â†“
If no winner â†’ AI's Turn (O)
    â†“
AI calculates best move (Minimax)
    â†“
AI places O & check win
    â†“
If no winner â†’ Player's Turn
    â†“
Repeat until someone wins or draw
    â†“
Show result dialog
    â†“
Play Again or Exit
```

## Testing the Game

### Basic Tests
1. **Start a game** - Verify board appears
2. **Make moves** - Click cells, verify X appears
3. **AI responds** - Verify O appears after delay
4. **Win a game** - Get 3 in a row (if you can!)
5. **Draw scenario** - Fill board with no winner
6. **Score tracking** - Play multiple rounds, verify scores update

### Test Win Conditions
- Top row: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)
- Middle row: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- Bottom row: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)
- Left column: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
- Middle column: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)
- Right column: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)
- Diagonal \: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)
- Diagonal /: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)

### Test AI Behavior
1. **Blocking**: AI should block when you have 2 in a row
2. **Winning**: AI should win when it has 2 in a row
3. **Corner strategy**: AI often takes center or corners
4. **No mistakes**: AI should never let you win easily

## Menu Options

### During Game
- **Menu button** (top left)
  - Resume - Continue playing
  - New Game - Reset scores and board
  - Settings - App settings
  - Quit - Exit to main menu

- **Info button** (top right)
  - Opens How to Play guide

### After Game Ends
- **Play Again** - New round, keeps scores
- **Exit** - Return to main menu

## Database Integration

### What's Saved
When you complete a game:
- Total games played (incremented)
- Total wins (if you win)
- Win rate (calculated automatically)
- Total score (your current round score)

### Where It's Saved
- Room Database
- GameStatsManager handles updates
- Linked to your user profile (or guest account)

## Tips for Players

1. **Center Control**: Try to take the center (1,1) on first move
2. **Corner Strategy**: Corners are strong positions
3. **Fork Creation**: Try to create situations with multiple winning threats
4. **Expect Draws**: Against this AI, most games end in draws
5. **Learn Patterns**: Watch how the AI blocks and attacks

## Troubleshooting

### Game doesn't start
- Check that MainActivity passes "single" as GAME_MODE intent extra
- Verify all cell IDs exist in XML

### AI doesn't move
- Check logs for errors in minimax calculation
- Verify gameMode is set to "single"

### Cells not clickable
- Ensure gameActive is true
- Check that currentPlayer is PLAYER_X
- Verify cell hasn't already been played

### Stats not saving
- Ensure user is logged in (or guest session active)
- Check GameStatsManager implementation
- Verify database permissions

## Performance Notes

- **AI Speed**: Minimax runs instantly for 3x3 Tic Tac Toe
- **Memory**: Minimal usage (~9 strings + UI elements)
- **Responsiveness**: Runs smoothly on any Android device
- **Delay**: 500-1000ms artificial delay for better UX

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

   - Room-based games

5. **Add achievements**:
   - First win
   - 10 games played
   - Win streak tracking

## Summary

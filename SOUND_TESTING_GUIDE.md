# Sound System Testing Guide

## Sound Features Fixed

The app now has a working sound system with the following features:

### 1. Sound Effects
- **CLICK**: Button click sound (short beep)
- **MOVE**: Game piece movement sound
- **WIN**: Victory sound
- **LOSE**: Defeat sound
- **DRAW**: Draw game sound

### 2. Background Music
- Currently disabled (placeholder implementation)
- Can be enabled in Settings
- Will play continuously when implemented with actual audio files

## How to Test

### Testing Sound Effects:

1. **Launch the App**
   - You should see log messages in Logcat:
     ```
     SoundManager: SoundManager initialized - SFX: true, Music: true
     ```

2. **Navigate to Settings**
   - Main Menu → Settings (bottom right card)
   - Toggle "Sound Effects" switch
   - You should hear a click sound when enabled
   - Check Logcat for: `SoundManager: Sound effects enabled`

3. **Test in Game**
   - Go back to Main Menu
   - Click "Play Now" button (should hear a click)
   - Make a move on the game board (should hear a move sound)
   - Win/lose a game (should hear win/lose sound)
   - Get a draw (should hear draw sound)

4. **Check Logcat for Debug Info**
   ```
   GameActivity: Sound effects enabled: true
   SoundManager: Played sound: CLICK
   SoundManager: Played sound: MOVE
   SoundManager: Played sound: WIN
   ```

### Common Issues & Solutions:

#### No Sound at All:
1. **Check device volume**
   - Make sure media volume is not muted
   - Press volume up button while in the app

2. **Check device ringer mode**
   - Device must not be in silent mode
   - The app respects system silent mode settings

3. **Check app settings**
   - Settings → Sound Effects (should be ON)
   - Look for log: `SoundManager: Sound disabled or not initialized`

4. **Verify in Logcat**
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep -i "soundmanager"
   ```
   Should show:
   - "SoundManager initialized"
   - "ToneGenerator initialized"
   - "Played sound: XXX"

#### Sound Cuts Off or Doesn't Play:
1. **Check ToneGenerator initialization**
   - Look for: `ToneGenerator initialized with volume: 80`
   - If you see "Error initializing ToneGenerator", try restarting the app

2. **Memory issues**
   - Close other apps
   - Restart the device

### Settings Persistence:

The sound settings are saved in SharedPreferences and persist across app restarts:
- Location: `TableTussleSettings`
- Keys:
  - `sound_effects`: boolean (default: true)
  - `background_music`: boolean (default: true)

### Developer Testing:

To verify the sound system is working:

1. **Enable verbose logging**
   - All sound operations are logged with tag "SoundManager"
   - Filter Logcat by "SoundManager" to see detailed info

2. **Test sound toggle**
   ```
   Settings → Toggle Sound Effects OFF
   Expected log: "Sound disabled or not initialized. Enabled: false"
   
   Settings → Toggle Sound Effects ON  
   Expected log: "Sound effects enabled"
   Expected sound: CLICK tone
   ```

3. **Test in different scenarios**
   - MainActivity buttons
   - GameActivity moves
   - Game end dialogs
   - Settings toggles

## Technical Implementation

### SoundManager Features:
- Singleton pattern for app-wide access
- Uses Android ToneGenerator for reliable sound playback
- No external audio files required
- Respects system silent mode
- Proper lifecycle management
- SharedPreferences integration

### Sound Volume:
- ToneGenerator volume: 80% of max (adjustable)
- Respects system media volume
- Different tone types for different effects

### Lifecycle Management:
- Initialized once per app session
- ToneGenerator recreated if needed
- Proper cleanup on app exit
- Background music pauses when app is backgrounded

## Future Improvements

To add custom sound files:

1. Create `app/src/main/res/raw/` directory
2. Add audio files (e.g., `click.mp3`, `move.wav`, etc.)
3. Update SoundManager to load from resources:
   ```java
   soundEffects.put("CLICK", soundPool.load(context, R.raw.click_sound, 1));
   ```
4. Replace ToneGenerator calls with SoundPool playback

## Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] Device volume is turned up
- [ ] Device is not in silent mode
- [ ] Sound Effects setting is enabled in app
- [ ] Logcat shows "SoundManager initialized"
- [ ] Logcat shows "ToneGenerator initialized"
- [ ] No error messages in Logcat
- [ ] Other apps can play sound (verify device speakers work)

## Contact

If sound issues persist, collect:
1. Logcat output (filtered by "SoundManager")
2. Device model and Android version
3. Steps to reproduce the issue
